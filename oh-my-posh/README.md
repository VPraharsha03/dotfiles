Example to use as remote config:

```powershell
oh-my-posh init pwsh --config "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VPraharsha03/dotfiles/main/oh-my-posh/paradox_old.omp.json" | Invoke-Expression
```

âš  **CAUTION**
```
Be careful not to adjust the theme files in their original location as they're updated together with
Oh My Posh which will remove your customizations.
Always copy, or export them and save the new configuration outside of the Oh My Posh internal themes folder.
```
